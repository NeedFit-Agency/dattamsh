Importance of Machines 
Raju was a young boy. One day, he was going home from school. On the    
way, he saw his father working alone in the field. His father was very tired. 
The next day, Raju's teacher told him about machines. He asked his 
teacher if there was a machine that could help his father in the field. The 
teacher gave an example of a tractor and explained how it works. Raju 
shared this with his father. His father bought a tractor. The tractor helped 
Raju’s father in the field, making his work easier and saving time.

Computer Revolution - Room Size to a Phone
 A long time ago, computers were as big as a whole room! They had lots 
of big parts. These computers helped people do important things. But 
they were very, very big and costly. Then some scientists worked very 
hard to make computers smarter, and smaller. These computers were 
small enough to fit on a table (desktop). Most households started having 
a computer. Today, we have computers that fit in our pockets! These are 
called smartphones and tablets. They can do many things, like take 
pictures, play games, make phone calls, and send messages.

3 Computer Care and Safety
 Questions to ponder
 Ÿ How comfortably do you sit while using the computer?
 Ÿ How regularly do you clean your electronic gadgets?
 Just like you take care of your toys and games, it is very important to take care of 
your computer too. 
Taking Care of yourself while using the Computer
 1. Maintain Good Posture: Make sure you keep your back straight while 
using a computer.  
2. Adjust Screen Brightness: Ensure your screen brightness matches the
 lighting in your room to avoid eye strain. 
3. Take Regular Breaks: Do not sit in front of a computer screen for more than 
30 minutes at a time. Take a break every 30 minutes.  
27
 Computer Care and Safety
4. Stretch Regularly: Stand up and stretch your body every hour to keep your 
muscles relaxed and to prevent pain. 
5. Blink Often: Blinking keeps your eyes moist and 
reduces dryness from staring at the screen.
 6. Limit Screen Time: Take breaks from the screen 
to rest your eyes and mind. Engage in non-digital 
activities like reading a book or going for a walk. 
Activity: While you are in the computer lab, look at your friends. Make a 
list of the practices from above that they are not following. Let your friends 
know about this and correct them.

Let us now look at some tips on how to take care of our computers.
 Taking Care of the Computer
 1. Keep it Clean: Regulary clean your computer’s keyboard, screen, and small 
gaps to prevent dust from building up.  
2. Avoid Overheating: As air is very important for us to be healthy, in the same 
way, computers need proper air around them so that they do not get heated up. 
Do not use it on soft surfaces like beds or sofas. Instead, use it on a table.     
3. Handle with Care: If you need to move a desktop, ask your parents or teacher 
to do it for you. For laptops, do not drop and bump it.  Always lift it from the base, 
not the screen.
 29
 Computer Care and Safety
4. Avoid Eating and Drinking near the Computers: Spills can damage the 
computers. 
5. Shut Down Properly: Always shut down your computer properly to prevent

 Keyboard and Mouse Fun  
Ÿ Do we talk to a computer?
 Ÿ How do we tell a computer what to do? 
In this chapter, we will learn about the two important parts of a computer, the 
keyboard, and the mouse. 
Keyboard  
We use pencils or pens to write in a notebook, but how do you write on a 
computer? We use a keyboard for that.
 A keyboard is a board with many buttons on it. These buttons are called keys. 
We press on the keys to write text.
 Whenever we type on the keyboard, the text is visible on the monitor. While 
typing, a blinking line is seen on the screen which is called the cursor. It tells us 
the position where the text will appear on typing.       
Different Types of Keys on the Keyboard 
There are different types of keys on a keyboard, like:
 1. Alphabet Keys
 2. Numeric Keys
 3. Special Keys     
1. Alphabet Keys
 Ÿ These keys include letters from A-Z.
 Ÿ They help us write words and sentences.   
35

2. Numeric Keys 
Ÿ These keys include numbers from 0-9.
 Ÿ They are located on top of the alphabet keys and in some keyboards on 
the right-hand side.
 Ÿ These keys help us type numbers.   
3. Special Keys
 Ÿ
 k
 Space Bar Key: It is the longest key on the eyboard. It creates a space 
between words. 
Ÿ Enter Key: Enter key is used to move the cursor to type the text to a new line.   
Ÿ 
Caps Lock Key:
 The Caps L
 ock key makes the letters capital when you type. 
Ÿ Backspace Key: The Backspace key deletes the text to the left of the cursor.
 36
 PW Binary Brains - 1
Ÿ Delete Key: The Delete key removes the text to the right of the cursor or 
deletes selected items.   
Ÿ Direction Keys: Direction keys, also known as arrow keys, are used to 
move the cursor or pointer in a specific direction on the screen.   
There are more keys on the keyboard that you will learn about as you keep using 
the keyboard to type.

 When you have to show something to someone, you point it out to them with the 
help of a finger.
 In the same way, we can point out to things on a computer using a mouse. You 
move the mouse on the mouse pad that is placed on the table along side the 
keyboard. When you move the mouse, the mouse pointer or the cursor on the 
screen moves as per the movement of the mouse.

The Evolution from Keyboard to Touchscreen
 The Story of Kaya and Karan 
Once upon a time in the city of Kolkata, there were two best friends: 
Kaya and Karan. Kaya was a keyboard, and Karan was a touchscreen.
 Kaya’s early days:  Kaya, the keyboard, was very popular because 
people loved typing on her. Everyone used her, from kids in school to 
people at work.
 Karan’s arrival: One day, Karan, the touchscreen, came to the city. He 
was different because people didn’t have to press buttons; they just tapped 
or swiped on his smooth surface. Karan became very popular, especially 
on phones and tablets.
 Working together: At first, Kaya was worried that people might forget 
about her. But Karan told her, “Don’t worry, Kaya! We both can help 
people.” Soon, devices started to have both keyboards and touchscreens. 
People loved using both Kaya and Karan for different tasks.
 The future: Kaya and Karan realised they were a great team! People 
everywhere used both, the keyboard and the touchpad. Kaya was widely 
used on desktops and laptops and Karan was used on smartphones and 
tablets. Together, they made everyone’s work easier!
