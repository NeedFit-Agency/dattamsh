Operating Systems
What is an Operating System?
Questions to ponder
Android and iOS are operating system used in smartphones.
Imagine your computer as a busy office, and the operating system (OS) is the
boss of this office. Just like a boss helps organise work, so that everyone knows
what to do, the OS tells the computer parts what to do, so they work together
efficiently. Devices like smartphones and tablets also need an operating system
to run.
Without an OS, a device is not useful. It will not be able to perform basic
functions like logging in, opening apps, moving files, watching videos, or visiting
websites.
Microsoft Windows, mac OS, Linux are some of the most popular operating
systems used in computers.
An operating system (OS) is a special program that acts like the “boss” of a
computer. It helps organise everything inside the computer, making sure all parts
execute the work together smoothly.
An operating system (OS) is the most important software on a device. An OS
manages tasks, executes applications, and provides a platform for the user to
interact with the device. It also manages the device's memory, processes,
software, and hardware.
Operating Systems 7
Operating System: the Computer’s Boss
An operating system is like the computer’s boss because it handle three main
responsibilities.
1. Resource allocation (deciding who gets what)
Ÿ The operating system decides which programs, like
games or apps, get to use the CPU (the computer’s
brain), memory (where short-term information is
stored), and storage (where files are saved).
Ÿ For example, if you’re playing a game and listening to music, the OS makes
sure each program gets enough resources to run smoothly and doesn’t slow
down.
2. Process management (organising
tasks in order)
Ÿ The OS manages the order of tasks on
the computer. It decides which tasks
are more important and should be
completed first.
Ÿ This way, the computer won’t get
overwhelmed by trying to do too many
things at once, and apps won’t get in
each other’s way. The OS ensures
everything runs smoothly and in the
right sequence.
3. User interface (making it easy to use)
Ÿ The OS provides a friendly interface with
icons, folders, and menus, making it easy for
the user to interact with the computer.
Ÿ Instead of typing out complex instructions,
you can click on icons and navigate menus
to open programs and find files. The OS
takes care of all the commands needed to
operate a computer.

How does an Operating System Work?
Imagine your computer is like a school, and the operating system (OS) is the
school's timetable. Just like the timetable organises the school day, the OS
organises the computer’s tasks.
On the computer
Ÿ The OS tells programs when they can use resources like the CPU,
memory, and storage.
Ÿ If a game needs more processing power, the OS makes sure other
applications, like the music player or browser, still get a fair share of the
resources.
Just as a timetable keeps the school schedule in order, an operating system
keeps the computer running smoothly.
Different Types of Operating Systems
Ÿ The timetable tells each class when they
will have subjects like maths, science, or
craft. It also makes sure each class gets its
turn to use the school’s resources like the
library, playground, or computer lab.
In school
Ÿ A timetable ensures all subjects get their
sufficient time in a day.

• Operating systems provide security features like
passwords and firewalls to keep data safe. Without an
operating system, the computer would have no way to
protect information, making it easier for unwanted access
or viruses to harm the computer.
4. Hardware compatibility
1. Complexity for users
• An operating system allows multiple programs to
run at the same time, like having a web browser
open while listening to music.
2. No multitasking
3. Security issues
What if there was no Operating System?
• Without it, the computer could only run one
program at a time. Users would have to stop one
program completely before starting another.
• The operating system manages the connection between
programs and hardware devices (like printers or keyboards). Without an OS,
every program would need specific instructions for each device, making it hard
to use new hardware or software.
• Without an operating system, users would have to give
direct commands to the computer's hardware. This means
they would need to type out complex instructions instead of
just clicking on simple icons or using menus.
Operating Systems 11
Components of an Operating System
1. Kernel
Ÿ Example: If you're playing a game and listening to music at the same time,
the Kernel makes sure both work without any hiccups.
Ÿ Think of the kernel as the “brain” of the computer's operating system. It
controls everything that happens inside the computer.
Ÿ It talks directly to the computer’s hardware, like the CPU (Central Processing
Unit), to make sure everything runs smoothly. It decides which tasks should
happen first and how to share the computer's resources.
2. User interface
Ÿ This is the part of the operating system
you can see and interact with. It’s like
the “face” of the OS.
Ÿ It lets you control the computer using
features like icons, windows, and
menus.
Ÿ Example: When you click on a folder
to open it, or when you use the Start
menu to find an app, you’re using the
user interface.
12 PW Binary Brains - 4
3. File management system
Ÿ The file management system is like
an organised librarian for your
computer. It keeps all your files and
folders organised and easy to find.
Ÿ It saves your documents, pictures,
and games in the right place. It helps
you open, move, or delete them
whenever you want.
Ÿ Example: When you save a school
project, it’s the file management
system that remembers where it is, so
you can find it later.
4. Device drivers
Ÿ Every device has its own language, and the driver helps the computer and the
device understand each other.
Ÿ Device drivers are like “translators” that help the computer talk to hardware
devices like a printer, mouse, or keyboard.
Ÿ Example: When you plug in a new printer, the computer uses a device driver
to print your documents correctly.
5. System utilities
Ÿ Example: Programs like antivirus software protect your computer from
harmful files, and tools like "Disk Cleanup" help free up space by deleting
unnecessary files.
Ÿ These are special tools in the operating system that help keep your computer in
good shape, like a toolbox for fixing problems.
Ÿ They can clean up your computer, protect it from viruses, and help make it run
faster.

used it just for calling and sending text messages. It didn’t have a
touch screen or different apps.”
Preeti was surprised. “No games or internet? Just calls and texts?”
Her dad nodded. “Yes, it was very basic. Then, smartphones came
along with different apps. Then came along touch screens that you
could tap and swipe. Now we can play games, take pictures, listen

Questions to ponder
2 Introduction to Windows
We have learnt in the previous lesson that Windows is an operating system
(OS). An OS manages everything on your computer. It helps organise and run all
the parts of a computer. Without an operating system, you wouldn’t be able to
interact with your computer easily.
Windows provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to do many things
on your computer, like open programs, play games, browse the internet, watch
videos, and complete homework assignments. It acts as a bridge between you
and the computer’s hardware (like the keyboard, mouse, and screen), making it
easy to perform tasks without needing to know complicated commands.

Ÿ Windows was first made by a company called Microsoft in 1985. Back then,
computers looked very different and were harder to use.
Ÿ Early versions of Windows didn’t have all the icons, pictures, and colourful
menus we see today. They were mostly text and simple graphics.
Brief History: When windows started and how it has changed over time
Ÿ Over time, Microsoft has made many new versions of Windows. Each version
added new features to make it easier and more fun to use. For example, there
was Windows XP(2001), then Windows 7(2009), Windows 10(2015), and
now Windows 11(2021).
Ÿ With each new version, Windows became faster, safer, and had more
features.
Ÿ Supports multiple devices: Windows works on computers, laptops, and
tablets, so you can find it on many types of devices.
Why is Windows Popular?
Ÿ User-friendly interface: Windows uses icons and menus that are easy to
click on. You don’t need to know how to code or type long commands to use it.
Ÿ Widely used in schools and offices: Many schools and businesses use
Windows because it is simple and has the tools they need, like word
processors for writing, spreadsheet apps for calculations, presentations apps
for making presentations and much more.
Ÿ Lots of programs and games: Windows supports a large variety of
applications, programs, and games. Whether you want to do homework,
create art, or play a game, Windows has options for all of these activities.
Introduction to Windows 21
What can Windows do?
1. Organise your files: Windows helps you sort your files into neat folders, just
like organising your books into shelves.
2. Run multiple programs: You can play games, while listening to music, or
watch videos and do homework all at once. It is like having different toys to
play with at the same time.
3. Search tab: Windows helps you find applications and files quickly using the
search tab.
Ÿ Settings: The settings app in Windows lets you
adjust system features like sound, screen
brightness, and Wi-Fi connections.
Ÿ Airplane mode: Disconnects all wireless

Let’s Create a Folder
In Windows, right-click on your Desktop or in any folder. Choose "New," then
"Folder." Give it a relevant name, like "English files" or "Maths files" and save the
folder. You can save your files in the folder.
This PC is a place where you can see all
your folders, files, and storage devices. It

Switching between programs: Windows lets you do lots of tasks at once. You
can open several programs and switch between them easily.
Multitasking Features
CPU - Processors and their Speed
Ÿ Processor speed: The speed of the CPU can be considered similar to how
quickly you can solve a puzzle. A faster CPU can do more tasks quickly,
making everything run smoother. This speed is measured in gigahertz (Ghz),
which tells you how many billions of instructions the CPU can handle in a
second.
Ÿ CPU (Central Processing Unit): The CPU is the brain of the computer. Just
like your brain helps you think and solve problems, the CPU helps the
computer run applications and programs. It’s the one doing all the hard work
behind the scenes!
Earlier CPUs ran at 1-2 GHz, while modern CPUs typically range from 3-5
GHz, with some reaching over 5 GHz. This increase means faster and
smoother performance.

Questions for discussion:
2. How does the laptop manage to cool itself down when it starts to
overheat during heavy processing tasks?
1. Have you ever experienced a time when you were using a desktop or
laptop and it heated up? What happened?
“Ah, that makes sense!” Nameet said, happy to know the fans were doing
their job.
Worried, Nameet asked, “Why is the laptop heating up?”
His father explained, “The laptop has an Intel i5 processor, and when you
play games with lots of graphics, it works harder. The Windows OS notices
this and turns on the cooling fans to stop it from overheating. It’s like giving
the laptop a break so it stays cool.”

Introduction to File and its Types
Questions to ponder
3 Different File Types
Just like we use different boxes for different things at home (like a box for toys, a
box for clothes), computers use different types of files to store information. Some
files hold pictures, some store music, others store text, while others store videos.
The "file type" tells the computer and user what kind of information is inside that
file.
A file can be defined as a collection of data that give a complete set of
information about a certain item.
But why do we need different file types?
We need different file types because each type of information is unique. A picture
needs to be saved differently from a song, and a text document is different from a
video. If all the information was stored the same way, the computer would get
confused! Different file types help the computer know how to open and use the

like this: if you have a box, the label on it tells you what's inside. Similarly, a file
extension helps the computer and user know what’s inside the file and what
program can open it.
Where do we find it?
Look at any file name on your computer. After the name, there’s usually a dot
followed by a few letters. That’s the file extension! For example, if you see
"Periwinkle.png", "png" is the file extension.
Examples of file extensions
.txt .jpg .mp4
.pdf .zip

Why are file extensions important?
File extensions help the computer know how to open a file. If your computer sees
.jpg, it knows to open it with a photo viewer. If it sees .txt, it opens it with a text
editor. So, file extensions are helpful in making sure everything works smoothly.
Details of Common File Types
 or homework.
1. Text files: Text files are used to store written information, like stories, notes,
 Examples:
Ÿ .pdf files are used when you want to share a document without anyone being
able to change it. It looks the same no matter what device you open it on.
Ÿ .docx files are what you use in Microsoft Word. They can have fancy fonts,
bold letters, and pictures.
Ÿ .txt is the simplest form of a text file, containing just plain text without any
fancy formatting. For example, if you open a .txt file, it will look like a plain
notepad documet.
Ÿ .jpg (JPEG) is used for photos. It makes the picture smaller in size but still
looks clear.
 Examples:
Ÿ .png files keep the picture quality high and allow you to have clear
backgrounds (transparent).
2. Image files: Image files store pictures or drawings.
Ÿ .gif files can be used for animations. You may have seen funny or short
moving images.
Ÿ .svg files are used for logos or drawings that can be resized without losing
quality.
 Different File Types 37
5. Compressed files: Compressed files make big files smaller so they take up
less space or are easier to send to someone.
 Examples:
Ÿ .zip when you have several files or folders that you want to keep together or
share all at once, you put them into a ZIP file. This makes it easier to send or
store them in one single file.
38 PW Binary Brains - 4
Ÿ .avi is an older format that has a bigger file size and is not used as much
Ÿ .mkv is often used for high-quality videos like movies because it can hold
multiple audio tracks and subtitles.
 Examples:
now-a-days.
Ÿ .mp4 is the most common video format because it makes the video smaller
without losing too much quality, which is why it’s widely used.
3. Video files: Video files store your videos and movies.
Ÿ .aac files are commonly used in apps like Apple Music because they sound
better than .mp3 with a smaller file size.
Ÿ .wav files keep all the details of the sound but take up more space, which is
why they are used for high-quality recordings.
Ÿ .mp3 is the most popular audio file format because it compresses the sound to
a smaller size while still sounding good.
 Examples:
4. Audio files: Audio files store sound, like music or voice recordings.
Converting Files Online
Ÿ Easy sharing: Certain file formats are easier to share because they’re
smaller or more commonly used. By converting a file, you make it easier for
others to view or use without needing special software. For instance, it’s
common to convert PDF files to Word so that people can edit them easily.
Ÿ Space-saving: Sometimes, one file type takes up more space than another.
For example, a PNG image file can be large, but converting it to JPEG often
reduces its size, which means it uses less memory on your device. This can
be helpful when you have limited space or want to share the file quickly.
Why would you want to convert files?
Ÿ Compatibility: Different devices and apps support different file types.
Converting files makes sure you can open them on the device or app you’re
using. For example, some apps work better with JPEG images than PNG
images, so converting your file makes it easier to use.
Step 1: Choose an online converter.
Converting PNG to JPG Online
Ÿ Some popular options include: PNG2JPG or FreeConvert.
Ÿ Select a trustworthy website to convert your PNG file to JPEG.
Let’s learn how to convert files to different formats on the internet.
Ÿ .rar and .7z are also compressed formats that do the same job but in
 slightly different ways.
Let us go to the website PNG2JPG.
 Different File Types 39
Ÿ Once on the website, select the type of conversion, for example – PNG to JPG.
Step 2: Upload your PNG file
Ÿ Then upload your file by clicking the "Upload Files" button and selecting the
file from your computer.
Ÿ Check that the output format is set to as required. Most converters will
automatically select the format for you.
Step 3: Select the output format.
Step 4: Start the conversion.
Ÿ Click the "Download All" button to convert and download. The conversion
should only take a few seconds.
Step 5: Download your file.
Ÿ After the conversion is complete, download your new file.

File Types and Teamwork in the Digital World
They saved all their files in one folder. Now they wanted to send these files
to each other’s email addresses, but they faced a challenge. The files were
in different formats, and they were taking a lot of time to send one file at a
time. The group was confused and did not know how to proceed.
Their teacher, Ms. Sharma stepped in to help. She suggested creating a
ZIP folder to store all their files together, and also making it easier to
transfer and send their work to one another.
In a busy school computer lab, Class 4 students were tasked with creating
a group project on "The Wonders of Nature." Each student was responsible
for different types of content. Anaya collected beautiful nature photographs
in .jpg format, Rohan wrote a detailed report and saved it as a .pdf, Kiran
recorded a narration about the environment in .mp3, and Meera captured a
short video in .mp4.
Through this experience, the students learnt not just about managing files
but also about teamwork. They realised that understanding file formats and
working together effectively were key to making their project a success.
Questions for discussion:
2. Can you think of a time when you worked with friends on a project? How
did you handle differences in ideas or tasks?
1. How did the team handle their problem? What lesson can we learn from
their experience?

Did you know?
Ÿ MP4 players can play both MP4 videos and MP3 audio
files. However, MP3 players can only play MP3 audio files
and do not support MP4 video files.
Ÿ JPEG and JPG are two names for the same type of image
file format.
○ JPEG stands for "Joint Photographic Experts Group,"
which is the name of the organisation that created the
format.
Ÿ Most school and university notes are sent in PDF format.
This is because PDFs preserve the layout, formatting, and
content of documents, ensuring they look the same on any
device.
○ JPG is just a shortened version of the name.
Points to Remember
Ÿ Each file has a unique purpose, such as storing text, images,
music, or videos.
Ÿ Using the right file type helps the computer know how to open
and use each file correctly.
Ÿ Common file types and examples:
○ Text files: Store written information.
○ Image files: Store pictures and graphics.
Ÿ A file is designed to store specific information, just like how we
have specific boxes for toys, clothes, or books.
○ Video files: Store movies and video content.
○ Audio files: Store music and sound.
○ Compressed files: Store multiple files in one smaller,
compressed format.

Next, she created a table using the Insert Tab to list interesting facts about
pandas, like how they eat bamboo and sleep a lot. To make the table look
nicer, she used Table Design to add colour and borders.
Finally, she used SmartArt to show the panda life cycle, so that others
reading the document would understand the panda life cycle. Jessica was
proud of her colourful, well-organised report.

Jessica decided to create a project about her favourite animal, the panda,
using Microsoft Word. She started by adding a title, “All About Pandas,”
and inserted a picture of a panda from her computer.
Jessica added her name in the Header and the date in the Footer, then
included Page Numbers to keep everything organised. To make her project
even more creative, she added a Watermark that said "Panda Project."
