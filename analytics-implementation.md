## Phase 1: Frontend Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of institutional analytics feature (Phase 1) for Dattamsh. Phase 1 focuses on the frontend implementation of the data collection and session management.

### Components Implemented

1. **StudentInfoModal**: 
   - Enhanced with institution, grade, and class selection
   - Validation for required fields
   - Proper data storage in localStorage and Firestore

2. **Session Management**:
   - Generation of UUID-based session IDs
   - Persistent storage of session IDs and institutional context
   - Session timing tracked in localStorage

3. **Analytics Service**:
   - Enhanced analyticsService.ts with new methods for gameplay events
   - Added proper context attachment to analytics events
   - Implemented logGameplayEvent for standardized event logging

4. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Updated useAnalytics hook for easy integration in components
   - Added specialized methods for tracking different module states (start, progress, completion, quit)

5. **Testing UI**:
   - Enhanced analytics-test page for testing the implementation
   - Added buttons to test all event types
   - UI to verify session ID and institutional context

### Key Files Modified
