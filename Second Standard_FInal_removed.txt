More about Computers

Questions to ponder
Ÿ In which places have you seen a computer being used?
Ÿ How does a computer listen and talk?
Ÿ How does a computer turn your ideas into results?

Where do we use Computers?
1. Schools: Teachers use computers in school to teach children more about
topics by showing videos. Children learn computer skills in school using
computers. Computers are also used in school offices for accounting and to
keep records of teachers, staff, and students.

2. Shops: In shops, computers help in money transactions, check prices, and
keep track of what is sold.

3. Offices: In offices, people use computers to write letters, send emails, and
complete important tasks efficiently. Computers are also used in offices to
maintain records and to store information.

4. Hospitals: Doctors use computers to store patient information. Some
advanced computers also help operate machines used in medical procedures.

5. Home: We use computers at home to watch our favourite cartoons, play
games, type letters, draw and colour, to learn, watch videos, listen to music, etc.

6. Bank: Banks use computers to keep track of customer’s accounts and money.
They also help with withdrawing cash from ATMs.

What is a Computer made of?
Hardware and Software are the two main components of a computer system.

Hardware is the parts of the computer you can touch.
Example:
CPU cabinet

Keyboard

Monitor

Mouse

Activity: Can you name two other parts of computers that can be termed
as ‘Hardware’?
Hint: We have learnt about these parts in grade 1 as “Extra parts of the
Computer”.
Software is what makes the computer work. Software is a set of instructions that
tells a computer what to do. You can’t touch software. Without software, the
computer hardware is of no use.
Example:

MS Paint

Scratch

Notepad

Periwinkle App

Activity: Identify the pictures. Write ‘H’ for hardware and ‘S’ for software.

Input and Output Devices
Input is the instruction we give to a computer. We give instructions by typing
or clicking. These instructions tell the computer what to do.
Output is the result the computer provides, showing what it has done with our
input. The computer provides output on the screen or on printed documents.
Computers can "listen", that is, receive instructions from users using input
devices. Computers can "talk", that is, give results to users using output devices.

10

PW Binary Brains - 2

Input Devices: Listening
We have already learnt about these input devices and used them.

Keyboard

Mouse

More input devices are the scanner and the microphone.
Ÿ

Scanner: A scanner is a machine that helps
turn pictures and papers into digital files so you
can see them on the computer.
Example: If you put your drawing on the scanner, it will
take a picture of it and show it on the computer screen.

Ÿ

Microphone: A microphone is a device that helps
record sounds and voice on to a computer. Microphones
are used for talking, giving voice instructions, singing,
and recording music.

Output Devices: Talking
We have already learnt about output devices and used them.

Speakers

Monitor

Another output device is the printer.
Printer: It puts your drawing or words from the
computer onto paper.
Example: If you draw a picture, or type a
document on the computer, the printer prints
what you see on the monitor on to paper.

Activity: Identifying input and output devices.
Write "I" for input and "O" for output next to each device.
1. Keyboard: _______

2. Monitor: _______

3. Microphone: _______

4. Mouse: _______

5. Printer: _______

6. Scanner: _______

Concept of Input, Process, and Output

Ÿ

Input: Input is when we tell a computer to do something. For example, when
you type on a keyboard or click a mouse, you are giving instructions to the
computer. That's input.
Process: This is when the computer takes the instructions and works on
them. For instance, when you click "Print" on your computer, you give an
input or instruction to the computer. The computer then
processes that command and sends the document to the
printer. That’s the process. The ‘process’ is done by the
CPU (Central Processing Unit).

Ÿ

Ÿ

Output: This is when the computer shows the result after
processing the instructions. For example, the printer
gives you a paper copy of what you want. That’s the output.

Caselet
Tina’s Big Day with the Computer
Tina was excited because today her teacher, Miss Lily, was teaching the
class about computers! Miss Lily asked, “Where do we use computers?”
Tina raised her hand and said, “We use computers at home, in schools,
and even at shops!”

Miss Lily showed them different parts of the computer. She pointed to the
monitor, where they could see pictures and words. Then she held up the
keyboard with lots of buttons for typing and the mouse that helps us
click. She also showed the speakers for sound and a printer that prints
on paper.
These parts are called input and output devices, explained Miss Lily.
“When you type or click, you’re giving input. And when you see things on
the monitor or hear sounds, that’s the output!”
Finally, Miss Lily explained how computers work: input, process, and
output. She said, “If you want to draw, you use the mouse to give input,
the computer processes it, and your picture appears on the screen as
output!”
Tina had a lot of fun learning and couldn’t wait to share what she learnt
with her family.
Questions for discussion:
1. Where have you seen people using computers?
2. What parts of the computer did Tina learn about?
3. What’s the difference between input and output?

Exploring How to Write on a Computer
Saketh is a little boy who loves to write stories. He has a notebook
where he writes about his fun trips to the park, his favourite toys, and
his playful pet dog, Ruby.
One day at school, Saketh’s teacher introduces him to Notepad on the
computer.
“Saketh”, she says, smiling, “You can type your stories on the computer
using Notepad! It’s just like your notebook, but it’s on the screen!”
Saketh's eyes light up with excitement. He opens Notepad and sees a
blank white page waiting for him. He starts typing his favourite story
about Ruby. As he types, the letters pop up on the screen.
When he finishes his story, Saketh wants to keep it safe. His teacher
shows him how to do it. Saketh gives a special name to his story:
“RubyAdventure.” He clicks ‘Save’ and feels proud.
Saketh loves using Notepad because he can keep his stories neat. He
can always come back to his story whenever he wants to read it or
make it even better.

Drawing with MS Paint (Part 2)

Questions to ponder
Ÿ If you could paint a big rainbow, how would you do that on
a computer?
Ÿ How would you add a name to a picture on the computer?
We all like to paint with different things like brushes, crayons, or wax colours,
right? In this lesson, we will explore more features of MS Paint!
You know how to draw and fill a shape with colour. Now it’s time to discover new
tools. We will learn to use lines, curves, and brushes, add words to our pictures,
and undo or redo actions if we want to make changes.

Exploring Lines, Curves, and Brushes
When you open MS Paint, you’ll see a section at the top called the Ribbon.
The Ribbon holds all the tools you need to create your drawings.
You'll find the following tools on the Ribbon.
Ÿ Selection tools: To choose parts of your drawing.
Ÿ Image editing tools: To change or adjust your drawing or elements in your
drawing.
Ÿ Drawing tools: Such as Pencil to draw and Brushes of different strokes to
draw and colour. There’s also a Text Tool for writing, and an Eraser tool for
erasing parts of drawings.
Ÿ Shape tools: To draw shapes like squares, circles, stars and many more.
Ÿ Colours tool: A colour palette full of bright colours to choose from.
Ribbon

Ÿ Line Tool: In MS Paint, using a Line tool you can
draw straight lines. Just click on the “Line” tool. Click on
the drawing area where you want the line to start, and
drag it to where you want it to end, and release the
mouse button.

Ÿ Curve Tool: In MS Paint, using a curve tool you can draw curved and wavy lines.
To make a curve, click on the “Curve” tool. Draw a straight line first, then click and
drag the line to make it curve. If you want to draw a mountain on the computer you
can use the curve tool.

You can draw these using the curve tool:

Ÿ Brushes: The Brushes tool in Microsoft Paint is a drawing tool that lets you
apply colour to an image using various strokes and styles.

36

PW Binary Brains - 2

When you click on the Brushes tool in MS Paint, you
see different kinds of Brushes.
Each makes different strokes:
Ÿ Some Brushes create big strokes, which are great
for drawing large shapes.
Ÿ Others make small strokes, perfect for adding tiny
details.
Ÿ There are also Brushes that create smooth, soft
lines, useful for mixing colours.
Steps
Step 1: Click on the Brushes tool to see the different options. Select the type of
stroke you want to use.
Step 2: Use the selected stroke to draw on the drawing area by dragging the
mouse pointer.
Step 3: Now create simple or complex drawings based on your imagination.

Fixing mistakes in MS Paint
Just like you fix mistakes with an eraser on paper, you can fix mistakes in MS
Paint. Let us see how.
1. Use the Eraser: If you want to fix a part of your picture, you can use the
Eraser. Click on the Eraser Tool (it looks like a pink block). You can adjust the
size of the eraser.
A scroll appears when you select the Erase tool. By moving the scroll up or
down, you can choose the size of the eraser. Use a small size for tiny mistakes
and a big size for bigger areas.
To erase, click the mouse button and move it over the part of your drawing that
you want to erase. When you're done, let go of the mouse button, and you can
draw or paint on it again.

2. Undo a mistake: If you make a mistake and want to undo that particular step,
click the Undo arrow - the arrow that goes backwards. It is on top of the screen.
It looks like a curved arrow pointing to the left. This will make the last step you
did go away.

3. Redo your work: If you undo something by mistake and want it back, click the
Redo arrow - the arrow that goes forward. It is on top of the screen. It looks like
a curved arrow pointing to the right. This will bring back what you took away.

Activity: Drawing what you see with MS Paint.
1. Find a Picture: Look around your room or outside for a picture or a thing.
It could be a cup, a pencil, fruit, or a favourite book.
2. Open MS Paint: Click on the Paint icon on your computer to open
MS Paint.
3. Draw what you see: Use the tools in MS Paint to draw the thing you
found. Try to make your drawing look like the picture or thing you chose.
4. Add Details: Add colours and small details to make your drawing look
even more like what you see. You can use colour tools and different tools to
make your picture look great.
5. Share your Drawing: Save your drawing. Ask a family member to look at
your drawing. Tell them what you drew and how you used the tools to make
it.

Correcting Mistakes and Improving in MS Paint
Nidhi wanted to create a picture of tall mountain ranges with curved
peak using MS Paint. She felt excited as she imagined how she would
draw the peak reaching into the sky.
She started by choosing a brown colour for the mountain and began
drawing its shape. However, while drawing one side of the mountain,
she accidentally made it too small, which didn’t look right. Feeling a bit
sad, she remembered the undo button. With a quick click, the mistake
disappeared. She smiled and tried again, drawing a mountain as she
wanted.
After finishing the mountains, Nidhi added a blue sky above it. Finally,
she wrote, “I love mountains!” in colourful letters. When she showed
her drawing to her friends, they loved it!

Through this experience, Nidhi learned that making mistakes is okay.
The undo button helped her fix her work easily, showing her that
mistakes are a part of learning. She also realised that everyone makes
mistakes in life, and one should always keep trying.
Questions for discussion:
1. Which tool do you think Nidhi used to draw her mountain?
2. What button did Nidhi think of that helped her correct her mistake?
